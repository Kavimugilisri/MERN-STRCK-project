        <h3><p>The identification of objects in an image. This process would probably start with image processing techniques such as noise removal, followed by (low-level) feature extraction to locate lines, regions and possibly areas with certain textures.  </p></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><p> The clever bit is to interpret collections of these shapes as single objects, e.g. cars on a road, boxes on a conveyor belt or cancerous cells on a microscope slide. One reason this is an AI problem is that an object can appear very different when viewed from different angles or under different lighting. Another problem is deciding what features belong to what object and which are background or shadows etc. The human visual system performs these tasks mostly unconsciously but a computer requires skilful programming and lots of processing power to approach human performance. Manipulating data in the form of an image through several possible techniques. The image is the group of many pixel in different size. The word image is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, or an abstract painting. An image is usually interpreted as a two-dimensional array of brightness values, and is most familiarly represented by such patterns as those of a photographic print, slide, television screen, or movie screen.  </p></h3>

        <h3><p>Originally, PGF has been designed to quickly and progressively decode lossy compressed aerial images. A lossy compression mode has been preferred, because in an application like a terrain explorer texture data (e.g., aerial orthophotos) is usually mid-mapped filtered and therefore lossy mapped onto Lossy compression provides higher levels of data reduction but result in a less than perfect reproduction of the original image. It provides high compression ratio. lossy image compression is useful in applications such as broadcast television, videoconferencing, and facsimile transmission, in which a certain amount of error is an acceptable trade-off for increased compression performance.   
            the terrain surface. In addition, decoding lossy compressed images is usually faster than decoding lossless compressed images. . To report this trade-off we  comparison between JPEG 2000 and PGF and we show for the same test series as in the corresponding average decoding times in relation to compression ratios.   PGF takes two times longer than JPEG and for higher compression ratios (> 30) it takes only ten percent longer than JPEG. These test results are characteristic for both natural images and aerial ortho-photos.
